    <img class="smallimg" src="images/image_2.jpg" alt="Memory Collecting">
    <p>Collecting memories since '95. I spend most of my time doing things that I don't completely understand. To control my expectations, I tend to think that everything is a Proof of Concept of something bigger (or smaller). When I don't know what else to do, I plan a trip or write a song.</p>
